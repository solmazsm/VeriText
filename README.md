# Dataset
VeriText Dataset: The VVeriText dataset is a collection of news articles that have been indexed using vector embeddings for efficient search and retrieval. It contains a vast array of articles spanning various topics and sources, providing researchers with a rich corpus for exploration and analysis.

The dataset encompasses news articles from multiple sources, including but not limited to those compiled by the NewsCatcher team and the All the News dataset.

<a href="https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset">All the News:</a> This dataset contains 2,688,878 news articles and essays from 27 American publications, spanning January 1,2016 to April 2, 2020. It is an expanded edition of the original All the News dataset, which was compiled in early 2017. While the original dataset contains more than 100,000 articles, the new dataset’s greater size and breadth should allow researchers to study a wider selection of media.

<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/davanstrien/WELFake">WELFake:</a> The WELFake dataset consists of 72,134 news articles, with 35,028 classified as real and 37,106 as fake. This dataset was created by merging four well-known news datasets: Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, and BuzzFeed Political. The goal of this merger was to mitigate the risk of overfitting in machine learning classifiers and to offer a larger corpus of text data to enhance the training process for fake news detection models.

Dataset contains four columns: Serial number (starting from 0); Title (about the text news heading); Text (about the news content); and Label (0 = fake and 1 = real).

There are 78098 data entries in csv file out of which only 72134 entries are accessed as per the data frame.
